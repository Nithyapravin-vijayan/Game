# Two Player Box Game

## Project Overview

This is a simple two-player box game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is for two players to move through a series of boxes on the screen, with each player making decisions on whether to stay in the current box or move forward. The game is designed to be fun and easy to play, while also showcasing basic front-end development skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:


- **index.html**: This file contains the structure of the game, including the HTML elements such as boxes, buttons, and instructions for the players.
- **style.css**: This file includes styles for the game, including the layout, colors, and spacing. The layout is designed to be clean and simple, with each box clearly marked and the buttons positioned prominently.
- **script.js**: This file contains the main game logic, including functions for player movement, tracking which player is active, and handling user interactions.

## Key Decisions

1. **Design and Layout**: We opted for a minimalistic design to keep the focus on gameplay. The boxes are arranged horizontally, and the buttons for player decisions ("Yes" and "No") are centered in a modal for easy access.
   
2. **Two-Player Interaction**: The game is turn-based, allowing each player to make a decision on their turn. We used a simple JavaScript function to toggle between players and to display prompts for player actions.

3. **GitHub Setup**: The project was initialized as a Git repository and uploaded to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Issues Encountered

- **GitHub Repository Setup**: Initially, there were issues with setting up the remote repository and pushing changes. We ensured that the GitHub repository URL was correct and re-initialized the Git settings to resolve the problem.
  
- **Button Spacing**: In early stages, the buttons for player decisions were too close together. CSS styling adjustments were made to add proper spacing between buttons.

## Future Improvements

- Adding more levels with different challenges.
- Implementing a scoring system to add competitive elements.
- Enhancing the UI for a more interactive user experience.

## Getting Started

To run the game locally, clone the repository and open `index.html` in your browser.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nithyapravin-vijayan/Game.git
cd Game
open index.html



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




This README file provides a summary of the project, describes the structure, explains the rationale for some decisions, and highlights any issues encountered along the way. You can add more details as needed, especially as you continue to work on the project.
